# fMRI Comprehensive Analysis Tool

This is a comprehensive tool to be used for fMRI analysis. It brings together SPM (all steps of preprocessing, first level, and second level), PLS, and CONN and anables a complete analysis through a couple of simple settings. It structures the folders in a very intuitive way.

You need to put your settings in the file "loadSettings" and run "runFmriAnalyses" afterwards.
